# Evidence relating to defacement of museum art
This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the defacement of museum art. 

Even though there is evidence of the possible theft of stamps I did not see any evidence or knowledge of the defacement of property within the National Gallery of Art from Tracy. If there was a motive to deface any of the gallery’s property it did not come from Tracy. 
# Conclusion
Tracy Was involved with giving insider information, planning, and gathering supplies for the heist. There is evidence of the conversation between her needing money, working with her brother to plan the heist (which includes blackmail of the individual aliased as King), As well as going to multiple locations to get supplies for the heist. Further evidence reveals that she found the stamps on display to worth a substantial value due to the insurance reports which can be seen in Appendix A. And based on Appendix B you can point out the locations that she went to to find the supplies that the individual named King wanted to complete the heist. Tracy doesn’t not seem to have any other motive besides trying to steal the stamps from the National Gallery of Art for financial gain.
